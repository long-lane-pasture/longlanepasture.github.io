			<h2>The Pasture</h2>
			<p>
				The Pasture is a wild meadow. It is a bit rough in places and can be
				very wet after rain and in the late autumn/winter/early spring months.
				Make sure you have stout footwear, particularly at these times of year,
				and watch your step as you wander around. It will take you about 20-30
				minutes to walk around the Pasture, but much longer if you linger awhile
				to appreciate its beauty. A list of wildlife you might see on your visit
				is posted on the Noticeboard by the entrance, where there is a map of
				the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is one short hard surfaced all-weather footpath, which takes you
				alongside butterfly border and the pond to a seating area. This is
				suitable for those a little unsteady on their feet, for wheelchairs and
				pushchairs. Other access around the Pasture is by way of informal grassy
				footpaths. There are a number of seats provided for visitors.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will see that some areas are not to be walked across. These are
				being kept as undisturbed areas for wildlife. Please observe the
				boundaries of these areas and do not venture into them. Respect wildlife
				at all times: do not pick flowers or take anything from the site ‚Äî leave
				for others to enjoy. If you see anything unusual, we would love to hear
				from you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Access is free of charge, but as a small registered charity we rely on
				donations and the support of our Friends to maintain and restore the
				Pasture.

			<h2>Location</h2>
			<p>
				Long Lane Pasture lies in North London, in the London Borough of Barnet,
				on the border between postal districts N3 and N2. It is bounded by the
				North Circular Road, the Northern Line railway, Pointalls Allotments
				land and Long Lane. It is accessed by a pedestrian gate which leads off
				a footpath at the end of a short access road (opposite Finchley Fire
				Station) just by the North Circular Road bridge over Long Lane.
