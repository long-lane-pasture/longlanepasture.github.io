				The pasture is a nature reserve. It is managed by the Long Lane Pasture
				Trust and is maintained by volunteers. Purchased for public recreation
				in 1912, it was neglected for many years and recently threatened by a
				housing development.

				Come and enjoy the tranquility of the pasture and the wildlife. It is a
				haven for birds, butterflies and wild flowers. Please respect the
				wildlife and keep dogs on a lead.
