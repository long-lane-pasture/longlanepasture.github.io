				Finchley.

			The presence of the bird of prey is testament to the regeneration of
			nature and wildlife in this 2.6-acre green oasis since it was put under
			the loving care of volunteers 12 years ago. The pasture, opposite the fire
			station on Long Lane, is open every day from 10am to dusk and you can find
			special events at www. longlanepasture.org.
