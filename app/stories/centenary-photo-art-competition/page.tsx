			One hundred years ago, in 1912, Long Lane Pasture was purchased for public
			enjoyment and recreation. To commemorate this landmark our Photo and Art
			Competition has been launched to create a visual record of the site
			through the seasons.

			Entries will be displayed in an exhibition at the Arts Depot, North
			Finchley, during October 2012 and will be considered for inclusion in our
			2013 Long Lane Pasture Calendar.
