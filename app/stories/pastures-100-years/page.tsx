			<strong>
				To celebrate 100 years of the Long Lane Pasture, an exhibition of
				paintings, sketches and photographs ran at artsdepot, North Finchley,
				throughout the month of October, showing more than 100 views of the
				pasture, its wildlife, flowers and some quirky observations
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Titles such as Fox by Moonlight, Bee at Sunset, Chaffinch in Snowy
			Hawthorn, Contorted Hazel, Ladybird on Ropesnake and Pasture with Clouds
			give some indication of the variety on view.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was added to by pupils from Year 5 at Tudor Primary School, who had
			visited the pasture during Environment Week. The lovely work produced by
			the nine- and ten-year-olds in Chestnut Class proved their interest in
			art, nature and the environment, for which they were awarded a special
			certificate.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you missed the exhibition, selected entries will appear in the Long
			Lane Pasture Calendar 2013, which will be available soon. Long Lane
			Pasture, which was originally used for grazing and to grow hay for horses,
			was purchased by the council in 1912 for public enjoyment and recreation.
			Local residents had a long struggle to make it what it is today. For
